# Activity-Selection

Created for USM Computer Science CSC 413 - Algorithms.

This program was created for use of academic purposes. Feel free to use as desired but please give credit.

This is a simple c++ program to solve the activity selection problem. 

The program uses a greedy search algorithm to find the most activities to visit from an input schedule. 

The program can easily be modified to accept longer schedules and more activities with simple edits to the restrictor functions. There are securities in place for accepting a 0 value in the activities number. There is also security for the end time being before the start time. However, I did allow start and end time to be the same time. 

The program then outputs the entire schedule in a visual format and after selecting the activites, prints the selected activities in a visual format also. There is still code ,commented out, that will allow the printing in a standard numerical text style. For future expansions, this could be brought into its own function and both could be printed - Or possibly a menu to ask the user for their desired viewing style. 

See the output.txt for console log.
